# GD32F425 (experimental)

Klipper can run on GigaDevice GD32F425 MCUs via the existing STM32F4 codepath. This support is experimental and relies on the GD32F4xx being largely register-compatible with STM32F4x5 devices.

Build steps:
- In `make menuconfig` choose:
  - Micro-controller Architecture: `STMicroelectronics STM32`
  - Processor model: `GigaDevice GD32F425 (experimental)`
  - Clock Reference: select the board's HSE frequency (commonly 8/12/25 MHz) or `Internal clock` if applicable
  - Communication interface: pick `USB (on PA11/PA12)` or a `Serial` UART option that matches your board
  - Bootloader offset: choose according to your board (many use 16KiB or 32KiB; consult the vendor docs)

Notes and limitations:
- This target builds using STM32F407 headers and timings. It has been found to work on several GD32F4xx boards but is not guaranteed for all variants.
- If USB enumeration fails, try building for a UART interface and flashing over SWD or a board-specific bootloader.
- Some boards marked "GD32F4xx or STM32F446" may also work by selecting `STM32F446` directly. The `GD32F425 (experimental)` option offers a consistent choice for GD32F4xx boards.
- Flashing methods vary by board: SWD (ST-Link/J-Link), DFU/HID bootloaders, or vendor-specific tools. Use the method recommended by your board vendor.

Troubleshooting tips:
- Verify the external crystal frequency and selected clock reference.
- If the firmware appears to run at the wrong speed (timers/baud), recheck the clock reference and bootloader offset.
- For CAN, SPI, I2C, and SDIO, pin mappings should match STM32F4x5 conventions; confirm with your board schematic.
